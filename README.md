## WAVE - my mobile game
This is a project made around 2020 - 2021 (11th grade in High School) with Unity2D.  
It was 100 hours of solo development. In game graphics were made by me with Aseprite and Photoshop.  
There are many aspects in the code that I would have written better if I programmed now :)
